# UXUI-Task-6
In Task 6, I designed a food delivery app for Admins, Restaurants, and Customers. Admins approve user accounts and manage the system. Restaurants can add dishes and view orders. Customers can browse restaurants, view available dishes, and place orders. The app is designed for smooth, efficient delivery service management.
